# Contributing to Rusty Path Of Building

## Reporting bugs
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching through existing [issues](https://github.com/meehl/rusty-path-of-building/issues).
- If the bug can also be reproduced with the official runtime (e.g. by running through wine), please open an issue in the [PoB1](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding) or [PoB2](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding-PoE2) repo instead. If you're unsure, feel free to just open it here.
- If possible, use the bug report template to create the issue and provide as much information as possible.

## Contributing code
- Get familiar with the code base before you start. I'll try to add more documentation providing a high-level overview of the architecture in the future. Until then, feel free to reach out through [Discussions](https://github.com/meehl/rusty-path-of-building/discussions) if you have any questions.
- If you intend to work on the API functions, also check out the [SimpleGraphic](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding-SimpleGraphic) code base. A great place to ask questions about it is the PoB dev discord server. [Here](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding-SimpleGraphic) is more info on how to join.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
